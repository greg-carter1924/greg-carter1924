- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @greg-carter1924
- ğŸ‘€ We're interested in solving an #elasticpress searh error on our #wordpress site. The ElasticPress search index of my woocommerce products is not finishing. We have not heard back yet from #10up who is representing ElasticPress search. The website name is gesrepair.com. @10up or @elasticpress can anyone assist with consulting?
ğŸ“« my email address is gcarter@electricalmarketing.net
